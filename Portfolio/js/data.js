about = `
    Hi, my name is 
    <h1>Jesse Groves.</h1> 
    I am a Computer Programmer that works with all sorts of development.<br><br> 
    I enjoy <strong>Web Development</strong> with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and eventually ReactJS for turning my websites into wep apps. I also dabble in the Node, Angular, and Vue JavaScript frameworks occasionally.<br>
    As well, I enjoy <strong>Game Development</strong> in any form I can make it with, whether that be in Unity with C#, Unreal with C++, or Python with the Pygame library.<br>
    I also have experience with the 60+ year old language of <strong>COBOL</strong>, which I hear is a good asset when converting legacy code-bases written in COBOL to more modern languages, that I also have knowledge in, like Java or Python.<br><br>
    In my education, I mostly learned Java, with a focus on Spring Boot for back-end applications. Since then I've picked up any technologies I thought were interesting,
    such as the JavaScript libraries and frameworks, but also others like Python, C++, C#,
