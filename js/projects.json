In the future I would like to host this page on a more dynamic platform so it can update automatically when I publish a new project. As of right now, it's hosted on github pages, which only offers static webpage hosting, so I can't use a database to update my projects, and so I am relying on manually inputting the title, description, weblinks, etc. for each project into a JSON file.",
